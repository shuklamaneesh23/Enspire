Here , this is project created using react with vite ,in this project i have used react-router-dom along with react-vite and tailwind css.
Every link here in this project is clickable and working fine and is able to redirect you to desired output.

There is one issue that when you switch the screen to mobile view ,the navbar list items convert to hamburger and once you click on that 
the list items open up with blur background and hamburger goes on the top..In order to get the original navbar back you have to click 
on the hamburger symbol again after selecting option from the navbar .It might be good that if that hamburger symbol converts to cross
symbol on click but i am unable to do that.
